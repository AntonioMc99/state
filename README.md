Honestly, this project was way harder than I thought it would be. I kept running into random syntax errors, especially with TypeScript. Sometimes just missing one tiny bracket or using the wrong type would break everything, and I’d have no idea what I did wrong. It felt like I was fixing one thing just to break two more. Debugging took forever and the error messages weren’t always clear either. 
I struggled the most with trying to connect everything together without breaking the state. Figuring out how to pass props between components and make the stats update live was frustrating. There were moments where I seriously questioned if I was even doing it right. But I pushed through.
At the end of the day, I did learn a lot especially about how important clean structure and small details are in React and TypeScript. This wasn’t perfect, and I know there’s room for improvement, but I’m proud that I got it working.
